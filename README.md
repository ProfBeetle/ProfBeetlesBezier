# ProfBeetlesBezier
A hack week project to create a spline tool in Roblox. Mostly functional but needs some love/documentation/cleanup.


## Planed updates/changes:
* Add visual tool for changing node rotation.
* Add the ability to lock a handles distance from its control node while moving it.
* Add more export options.

# Controls

* B - then clicking on something will create a new spline
* N - adds a new node to the end of a selected spline
* P - inserts a node exactly between the currently selected one and the next node, not changing the curve
* [Del] - deletes a currently selected node
* X - Copies the current spline and flattens it's structure
